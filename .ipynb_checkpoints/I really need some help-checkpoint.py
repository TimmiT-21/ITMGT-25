def scytale_cipher(message, shift):
    '''Scytale Cipher.
    15 points.
    
    Encrypts a message by simulating a scytale cipher.
    A scytale is a cylinder around which you can wrap a long strip of 
        parchment that contained a string of apparent gibberish. The parchment, 
        when read using the scytale, would reveal a message due to every nth 
        letter now appearing next to each other, revealing a proper message.
    This encryption method is obsolete and should never be used to encrypt
        data in production settings.
    You may read more about the method here:
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale
    You may follow this algorithm to implement a scytale-style cipher:
    1. Take a message to be encoded and a "shift" number. 
        For this example, we will use "INFORMATION_AGE" as 
        the message and 3 as the shift.
    2. Check if the length of the message is a multiple of 
        the shift. If it is not, add additional underscores 
        to the end of the message until it is. 
        In this example, "INFORMATION_AGE" is already a multiple of 3, 
        so we will leave it alone.
    3. This is the tricky part. Construct the encoded message. 
        For each index i in the encoded message, use the character at the index
        (i // shift) + (len(message) // shift) * (i % shift) of the raw message. 
        If this number doesn't make sense, you can play around with the cipher at
         https://dencode.com/en/cipher/scytale to try to understand it.
    4. Return the encoded message. In this case, 
        the output should be "IMNNA_FTAOIGROE".
    Example:
    scytale_cipher("INFORMATION_AGE", 3) -> "IMNNA_FTAOIGROE"
    scytale_cipher("INFORMATION_AGE", 4) -> "IRIANMOGFANEOT__"
    scytale_cipher("ALGORITHMS_ARE_IMPORTANT", 8) -> "AOTSRIOALRH_EMRNGIMA_PTT"
    Parameters
    ----------
    message: str
        a string of uppercase English letters and underscores (underscores represent spaces)
    shift: int
        a positive int that does not exceed the length of message
    Returns
    -------
    str
        the encoded message
